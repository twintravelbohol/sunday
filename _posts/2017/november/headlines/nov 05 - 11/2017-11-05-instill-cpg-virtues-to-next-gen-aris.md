REP. Erico Aristotle Aumentado (Bohol, 2nd District) exhorts the present generation to instill in their hearts and minds the virtues and traits of the late President Carlos P. Garcia.

On the 121st birth anniversary of Bohol’s Most Illustrious Son yesterday, Aumentado urged everyone to make CPG’s virtues and traits their way of life.

This way, he said, they can – especially the youth – in turn, bequeath these traits to the generations to come.
The solon said the boy from SitioLuy-a of Barangay San Agustin in Talibon town grew up to be a lawyer and a teacher before he threw his hat into the political arena. From there, there was no turning back for him. As he rose from the ranks and to fame, he remained humble. And was very patriotic.

More than for unity, he pushed for the Filipino First Policy.

By buying Filipino products, the citizenry can help those in dire need. It helps the people create unity – not divisiveness, Aumentado explained.

He said it was the president who had called his namesake father and immediate congressional predecessor Erico Boyles Aumentado shortly before the former stepped down from his position.

The President had asked the senior Aumentado that, should he have the opportunity, to continue his dreams for Bohol: irrigated lands, concrete roads, power and water available for all.

This became the beacon that guided him during his own stint in public service, hence, the Bohol Circumferential Road Project Phases 1 and 2, the Leyte Bohol Interconnection Project Phases 1 and 2 and the Bohol Irrigation Project Stages 1 and 2, among others, that he implemented during his terms as congressman and later, governor.

The younger Aumentado takes pride that the former President was born in Talibon. The town is within the jurisdiction of the 2nd District.
